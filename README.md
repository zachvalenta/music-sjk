Big L
> and when it comes to gettin' nookie I'm not a rookie / I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like whoopie - put it on
> everybody wanna be like Mike / but Mike wanna be like L
> Every minute, my style switches up / they say a real man / Won't hit a girl / well I ain't real cause I beat bitches up - danger zone
> I got slugs for snitches / no love for bitches / puttin thugs in pictures / when my trigger finger itches - Jay Z freestyle

Mac grand finale

> And if by chance this is my grand finale / bury me in Allegheny County
> It's the most hated, so faded that I'm bow-legged / don't bathe, gross gang, smell like old lo-mein
> Shit, the flow dangerous, make you wanna do the wave / throw your bitch right off your lap and start a standing ovation
> The most strangest, master of the ceremonies / a fifth of Stoli then itâ€™s only Cher and Moby karaoke
> My bitch a shooter, call her Annie Oakley / get you for a pair of Kobe's, just got out on probation 
> and no famous friends for me, just old faces / I only go places wasted like I'm Joe Namath
> Not a king, I'm no David, music, I'm a crackhead / no hobbies and recreation, don't even know my address
> Self medicate, self education / Rick Rubin showed me transcendental meditation
